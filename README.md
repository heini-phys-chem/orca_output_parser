# orca_output_parser
```
get_csv.py "path to directory of output files"
```

This python script takes a path to orca output files and extracts [name, final energy, number of atoms, atom types, final forces and final xyz coordinates] and prints it to the terminal.
  
So far only for MP2 calculations...
